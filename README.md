# ELG API for BERT base fine-tuned for Norwegian NER

This git repository contains [ELG compatible](https://european-language-grid.readthedocs.io/en/stable/all/A3_API/LTInternalAPI.html) Flask based REST API for the BERT base fine-tuned for Norwegian NER

[Norwegian Transformer Model](https://github.com/NBAiLab/notram) contains information about the available open-source corpus and pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for NLP tasks. This API was developed based on the fine-tuned version of `nb-bert-base` on [NbAilab/norne](https://github.com/ltgoslo/norne) dataset, Bokmaal data part. The data can be loaded from HuggingFace library and is published under `CC0` License.

This ELG API was developed in EU's CEF project: [Microservices at your service](https://www.lingsoft.fi/en/microservices-at-your-service-bridging-gap-between-nlp-research-and-industry)

## Local development

Setup virtualenv, dependencies
```
python3 -m venv nb-ner-elg-venv
source nb-ner-elg-venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The fine-tuned model can be directly used, the [latest](https://huggingface.co/NbAiLab/nb-bert-base-ner)(17.11.2021) model is fine-tuned for NER task using the [NorNE](https://huggingface.co/datasets/NbAiLab/norne) dataset. The model is published under cc-by-4.0 license

To load the fine-tuned model into the local directory `local_nb_bert_ner`
```
python3 load_model.py
```

Optionally, one may want to fine-tune a pre-trained model. For that, the pre-trained model `nb-bert-base` is available in Huggingface, and [here](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/peregilk/6f5efea432e88199f5d68a150cef237f/-nbailab-finetuning-and-evaluating-a-bert-model-for-ner-and-pos.ipynb) is the Google Colab to fine-tune it. The model once trained can be also used locally by saving the model to the local disk, script to save the trained model is available at the final cell in the same colab. 

Run the development mode flask app
```
FLASK_ENV=development flask run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Building the docker image

```
docker build -t nb-ner-elg .
```


Or pull directly ready-made image `docker pull lingsoft/nb-ner:tagname`.

## Deploying the service

```
docker run -d -p <port>:8000 --init --memory="2g" --restart always nb-ner-elg
```

## REST API

### Call pattern

#### URL

```
http://<host>:<port>/process
```

Replace `<host>` and `<port>` with the hostname and port where the 
service is running.

#### HEADERS

```
Content-type : application/json
```

#### BODY

For text request
```json
{
  "type":"text",
  "content": text to be analyzed for NER task
}
```
#### RESPONSE

```json
{
  "response":{
    "type":"annotations",
    "annotations":{
      "<NER notation>":[ // list of tokens that were recognized
        {
          "start":number,
          "end":number,
          "features":{ "word": str, "score": float }
        },
      ],
    }
  }
}
```

### Response structure

- `start` and `end` (int)
  - the indices of the token in the send request
- `word` (str)
  - word/phrase that is recognized with entities
- `score` (float)
  - confidence score of the entity, log likelihood probability.

### Example call

```
curl -d '{"type":"text","content":"Svein Arne Brygfjeld, Freddy Wetjen, Javier de la Rosa og Per E Kummervold jobber alle ved AILABen til Nasjonalbiblioteket. Nasjonalbiblioteket har lokaler b√•de i Mo i Rana og i Oslo."}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8000/process
```

### Response should be

```json

    "type": "annotations",
    "annotations": {
